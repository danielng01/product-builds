Dimmer

Version: 1.0
Release date: 07 Mar 2007
Developed by: Nelson Pires
Website: http://www.nelsonpires.com/software/dimmer/
Requirements: .NET Framework v2.0+


Description:
---------------------
A small utility designed to provide brightness adjustment for 
laptops or any LCD/TFT/LED screens that either dont have or lack 
proper brightness control.


Installation:
---------------------
Dimmer does not have an installer, simply extract all files into
a directory of your choice and run Dimmer.exe directly or from a
shortcut pointing to it. To uninstall simply delete all files.


Operation:
---------------------
The utility adds a small icon to the system tray, from which you 
can change the settings. The opacity adjuster starts at 5% because 
below this value its almost the same as if you are not using Dimmer
and ends at 95% due to the fact that 100% is total black and 
you wont be able to adjust back if you dont see where to click.
